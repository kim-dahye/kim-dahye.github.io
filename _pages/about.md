Hi, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year CS PhD student at Boston University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Deepti Ghadiyaram](https://deeptigp.github.io/). Prior to joining BU, I completed my Masterâ€™s degree at Yonsei University under the guidance of [Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEtk0QsAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests broadly span computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly passionate about understanding black-box machine learning systems and developing robust, reliable models to address real-world challenges.

ðŸ’­ My current research interests include
- Image generation / Diffusion models
- Interpretability / Safety

but not limited to!
