Hi, thanks for stopping by! <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/451e6a344c.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

I am a first-year CS PhD student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Deepti Ghadiyaram](https://deeptigp.github.io/). Prior to joining BU, I completed my Masterâ€™s degree at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp) under the guidance of [Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEtk0QsAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests broadly span computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly passionate about understanding black-box machine learning systems and developing robust, reliable models to address real-world challenges.

ðŸ’­ My current research interests include
- Image generation / Diffusion models
- Safety / Interpretability
- Video Understanding

but not limited to!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
